Changes Since Version 1.0:

* Game Speedup routines are totally changed. Parameters are better defined 
so that the game's difficulty increases more gradually and more evenly.
(Every 100 points, the dropping speed increases, but the number of active 
words gets halved. Every 20 words, number of active words increases by 
one.)

* Case Respect is added, for those who want maximum accuracy. If enabled, 
the words must be typed exactly as they appear.

* Duplicate words are not permitted on the screen, reducing confusion.

* Max. number of words is decreased to 30, instead of 50. 50 was too much, 
and was never reached.

* Source is cleaned up enough to be included in the package. Read it at 
your own risk :)

Take care, and happy typing..

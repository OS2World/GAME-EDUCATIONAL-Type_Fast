Tropical fish, whether large or small, carnivorous or herbaceous, are 
delicate and timid creatures.  They require little day to day care, but do 
need a consistent environment - clean water, fresh food and room to swim.  
Most fish are usually found in deep water or among thick plants or hiding 
in dim caves.  Your aquarium should provide the same types of terrain as 
found in the ocean.  Plenty of crevices in which to lurk, tall sea grasses 
and kelp plants for shelter, a good sandy bottom in which to lay.  

In the open sea, fish swim against the current.  The current gives them 
direction and brings food.  Still water will confuse most fish.  To keep 
your fish healthy and looking good, keep an artificial current of 3 to 5 
knots in the tank.  Every few days, rever se the current.  Water should be 
kept at a constant temperature.  Tropical fish from the Bahamas and Hawaii 
need warmer water than fish from the Northern waters.  Additionally, water 
gets colder as it gets deeper.  Most fish can adjust to temperatures 
slightly different from those of their native environment, but fish do not 
do well in constantly changing temperatures.  For best results, use real 
seawater.  Treated fresh water can contain chemicals fish do not encounter 
in the ocean.  The chemicals can cause damage to eyes, skin and gills of 
some types of fish.  Recirculating water in the tank will keep it cleaner 
and fille d with oxygen.  It also slows the evaporation rate.  DO NOT 
circulate water from one tank to another!  Water should go directly back 
into the tank it came from.  When adding new water to an existing tank, add 
it to the circulation system, never directly to the tank.  The circulation 
system will filter the water and bring it to temperature before it is added 
to the tank.  Fish eat almost constantly.  Feed your fish with fresh 
mackerel every 2 to 3 hours.  Keep plenty of brine shrimp and krill in the 
water.  Sea grass and kelp will give the smaller fish something to nibble 
on, but release dried seaweed into the water in the ev enings and early 
mornings when light is low.
